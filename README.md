## 1nj3ct0r Exploit

The 1nj3ct0r exploit is a proof-of-concept code that demonstrates how a remote attacker can exploit a vulnerable application by injecting and executing arbitrary code on the target system.

This exploit uses various techniques, such as command injection, input validation bypass, and encoding to bypass security measures and execute arbitrary code on the target system.

# Usage

To use the 1nj3ct0r exploit, you must have a vulnerable application running on the target system. The exploit code takes a command as input and generates various payloads using different techniques to execute the command on the target system.

The payloads generated by the exploit code can be used in different contexts, such as in the command-line, in HTTP requests, or in other vulnerable applications.
